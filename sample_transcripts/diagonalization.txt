okay so now we know what it means for
two matrices to be similar.
a matrix a is similar to a matrix b
if a equals x times b
times x inverse for some x. so what does
it mean for a matrix to be
diagonalizable.
well by definition we say that a matrix
a is diagonalizable
if a is similar to a diagonal matrix.
so here's an example illustrating uh the
equation
telling us that a certain matrix is
diagonalizable. here i have a four by
four matrix on the left let's call that
matrix a.
and what we're doing is we're expressing
a as the product of three matrices. this
matrix in the middle
is some matrix d and
d is being multiplied on the left by a
matrix x and
on the right by a matrix x inverse.
notice that d here is a diagonal matrix.
the only non-zero entries in d are off
of the diagonal
so this equation is telling us that a is
diagonalizable
and this is because a is similar to a
diagonal matrix.
now remember when a matrix
is similar to another matrix those two
matrices share
a lot of properties and in particular
they have
eigenvalues in common. well what are the
eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix.
the eigenvalues are exactly the diagonal
entries.
so that's one thing we can immediately
infer here the diagonal entries of d
in the diagonalizable or in this
diagonalization
are the eigenvalues of a.
so we see here this one equation
among many things as we'll see in a
moment is telling me that the
eigenvalues of a are negative 5
negative 1 3 and 7.
great so uh let's look at an example
illustrating the power of this concept.
so here i have a diagonalization
i have this matrix a which is similar to
this matrix d
via the this matrix x so
a is x times d times x inverse
and d here is a diagonal matrix.
well one thing we said about similar
matrices is that
if a is similar to d here the powers of
a
are related to the powers of d and so
one thing we could do is
if we wanted we could calculate the nth
power of a quite easily here,
the nth power of a which is a to the n
right here
is equal to x times
d to the n times x inverse.
and the idea here is that d to the n is
easy to calculate the nth power of
because d is a diagonal matrix
so all we have to do is find the nth
power
of each of the diagonal entries. and that
would be negative 1 to the n
and 2 to the n here we could then
multiply
x times d to the n times x inverse to
get
our formula for a to the n here. so
rather than multiply a
together a bunch of times all we have to
do is plug in the right value of
n here and we get a quicker result. so
that's one useful thing we can do
with a diagonalization like we have here.
now it's important to point out that not
all matrices are diagonalizable.
here let's look at this matrix on the
left here this is a matrix
an upper triangular matrix a where the
diagonal entries are 0
and in the top right corner we have the
number one.
i'm now going to argue to you that this
matrix is not diagonalizable.
well what would happen if it were
diagonalizable well.
that would mean that a is equal to x
times a diagonal matrix
times x inverse. and remember in the
diagonal matrix
the diagonal entries are the eigenvalues
of the matrix.
but here a is upper triangular and for
an upper triangular matrix
that the eigenvalues are the diagonal
entries.
so that would mean that in my diagonal
matrix here i would have to have zeros
but this is a problem because now my
middle matrix here is the zero matrix
and it doesn't matter what x is x times
the zero matrix times
x inverse is the zero matrix and this is
impossible because my original a was not
the zero matrix.
so this can't happen a here is not
diagonalizable because of of this
argument.
so a is not similar to any diagonal
matrix for this particular a.
so what we have now is this new concept
a matrix is diagonalizable
if it is similar to a diagonal matrix.
we've seen an example or we've seen a
few examples now of
a matrix that is diagonalizable but this
is an example of a matrix that is not
diagonalizable so we'll want to have a
theory which can sort this out.
in other words a theory which tells us
which matrices are diagonalizable and
which aren't.
um here is another example so
here we have a three by three matrix
that's diagonalized for us.
a is x times d times x inverse.
um i want to take a a look at the
eigenspaces of
d here. well d is diagonal
so when we go to look at the eigenspaces
all we're going to end up with
as the bases are the columns of the
identity matrix.
for lambda equals negative 7 here which
is our first eigenvalue
we'll get that the eigenspace is spanned
by
1 0 0 and 0 1 0.
and for lambda equals 4 which is our
third diagonal entry of d
here we find that for the matrix d the
eigenspace is spanned by zero
zero one. well what about the eigenspaces
of
a now well remember to get the
eigenspaces of a
we take the basis vectors for the
eigenspaces of
d here and multiplied by the matrix x.
and what happens when i multiply x by 1
0 0
and 0 1 0 i just end up plucking out the
first two columns of x.
what about and the thing to note here is
that for lambda equals negative seven
the eigen vectors of a
corresponding to negative seven are
exactly the first two columns of
x here and that's because the first two
entries on the diagonal of d
are negative seven. what about the second
eigenvalue lambda equals four.
well the eigenspace of d was spanned by
zero
zero one to get the eigen space of a.
we multiply 0 0 1 by x
well that will give us the third column
of x
1 negative 3 3 and that's because
this eigenvalue 4 is on in the third
position
on the diagonal of d here. so what it's
looking like from this example
is that to get the eigenspaces of
a given diagonalization all we're
really doing
is we're looking at the columns of the
matrix x
that pop out of this equation.
