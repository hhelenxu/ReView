so we have our definition of dimension.
it's the number of vectors and any basis
for the space you care about.
and the real punch line was from the the
the section immediately preceding this.
we know the dimensions of all four
fundamental subspaces of a matrix.
the dimension of the column space and
the dimension of the row space
is equal to the rank of the matrix. the
dimension of the null space is the
nullity of the matrix.
and the dimension of the left null space
is the nullity of the transpose.
there's all sorts of interesting things
we can say now for example.
we now have a theorem that connects this
idea of geometric multiplicity
to the idea of eigenspaces and the
theorem says that the geometric
multiplicity
of an eigenvalue of a matrix is the same
thing as the dimension
of the associated eigenspace. and the
proof here isn't difficult at
all it just ties together all these
concepts. remember
by definition the geometric multiplicity
of an eigenvalue
is the nullity of the associated
characteristic matrix
but the nullity of the associated
characteristic matrix we now know
is the dimension of its null space but
its null space
is what we define as the eigenspace. so i
have a little typo here this should say
dimension
of the eigenspace at the end i'll
correct that.
so this is just saying this thing we
call geometric multiplicity before
is the dimension of the null space of
the characteristic matrix
but the null space of the characteristic
matrix is the eigenspace.
let's look at an example here. someone's
been kind enough to take this three by
three matrix
and give us the eigenvalues. the
eigenvalues are negative three
and five. um well let's say that i wanted
to describe
everything in the eigenspace of this
matrix where lambda equals negative 3.
well how do we do this we're supposed to
look at the null space
of the characteristic matrix negative 3
times the identity minus the matrix.
and how do i look at the null space of a
matrix well i typically will reduce
that matrix. so i've bothered to find the
reduced row echelon form
of the characteristic matrix and here
what i'm finding
is that um there's only going to be one
free variable.
when i study the system uh that defines
the null space of this matrix
and i'll only get one linearly
independent solution
and all other solutions will be
multiples of this one.
so here i'm finding that i have one
basis vector
4 4 negative 1 for my eigenspace.
this is telling me that the dimension of
the eigenspace is 1
and that is the same thing as the
geometric multiplicity of
the eigenvalue .let's look at it
at the other eigenvalue the other
eigenvalue is lambda
equals five how do i describe
everything in this eigenspace. well the
way i describe everything in the
eigenspace
is by looking at the null space of the
characteristic matrix 5 times the
identity minus the matrix.
and the way we study this null space is
by row reducing that matrix
i plugged this characteristic matrix
into the computer and the computer told
me
that the reduced row echelon form was
this matrix.
and from here i see that i'll have two
free variables in my associated system
and this gives me two basis vectors for
the eigenspace
and that tells me that the eigenspace
has dimension two
which tells me that the geometric
multiplicity equals two.
so again we see this because the nullity
of the characteristic matrix is two
uh there are two uh um non-pivot columns
as evidenced by the reduced row echelon
form.
