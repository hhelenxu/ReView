now that we know how to complete the
Square, we can apply that a process to under to
better understand definiteness.
so if we complete the square for a
generic quadratic form, 
again that means we represent the
quadratic form with a real symmetric
matrix.
we find a spectral factorization and
write the quadratic form
as lambda times our change of variable
y1 squared
plus lambda 2 times our change of
variable y2 squared,
and then we keep going until we get to
our last eigenvalue
multiplied by yn squared.
the thing to point out here, is that
when we do this process, what we're doing
is we're taking a linear combination
of square terms. so if we if we care
about the sign of the quadratic form,
what we really care about are the signs
of the eigenvalues. here
so the eigenvalues of the symmetric
matrix representing the quadratic form
controls the definiteness of the
quadratic form.
explicitly what we're saying is that
being
positive definite is the same thing as
saying that the eigenvalues are all
positive numbers. being positive
semi-definite
is the same thing as saying that the
eigenvalues are all non-negative.
negative definite means the eigenvalues
are all strictly negative.
negative semi-definite means that the
eigenvalues are all non-positive,
and indefinite means there is at least
one positive eigenvalue,
and at least one negative eigenvalue.
so if you know the eigenvalues of the
symmetric matrix representing your
quadratic form
you immediately know the definiteness of
your quadratic form.
and the reason you know your
definiteness is because of the method of
completing the square.
so here's an example here we're looking
at the quadratic form
represented by this real symmetric
matrix.
s i bothered to find the eigenvalues
and i found that the eigenvalues of s
here are negative 2
negative 1 and what does that tell me
well the eigenvalues here are all
non-positive.
they're all not positive numbers um but
i do have zero on the list of
eigenvalues so they're not
strictly negative. so this tells me that
my quadratic form
is negative semi-definite but not
negative definite.
so if you know your eigenvalues you know
the definiteness of your quadratic form.
