much like people it is a fact of life that some matrices are nicer than others uh in this lecture i want to go over uh row echelon forms and specifically we'll talk about two what's called row echelon forms uh one will be much more prominent in this course than the other so let's jump right into it


um so the context here is um lots of matrices are very difficult to work with but some matrices are are easier to work with so let's say that we're working with an m by n matrix and let's say that matrix is called r so in this example our matrix looks like it's four by five um we say that our matrix is in reduced row echelon form if four things are satisfied so we need four rules to pass in order to call our matrix reduced row echelon form 


so what's the first rule the first rule says that if there are any rows that are full of all zeros those rows need to be at the bottom and in our example here we see that this rule passes the um only row in this matrix that's full of all zeros is the last row which of course is at the bottom so rule number one checks out for this matrix


so far so good rule number two all of the other rows so these are the rows where not every single entry is equal to zero although we could have some entries equal to zero these other rows have to have first non-zero entry equal to one and these are very very important uh entries inside of a reduced row echelon form matrix and they're so important that they have a special name these are called pivots so remember the last row in our matrix is all zeros so forget about that row it's at the bottom we're not worried about it and if we go to all the other rows here's the the first row the first non-zero entry is equal to one that is our first pivot if we look at the second row the first two entries are equal to zero that's fine the next entry is the first non-zero entry this entry is equal to one that's our second pivot our third row is the last row that's not all zeros its first three entries are equal to zero again totally fine but the first non-zero entry uh is right here in the three four position that position is equal to one that's our third pivot so the second uh rule for reduced for echelon form says all uh the first non-zero entry of um a a row that's not all zeros has to equal one and those positions are called pivots


what's the third rule the third rule says
that every pivot must occur to the right
of all of the pivots above it so if
we're looking at any pivot
and we look above for other pivots the
pivot we're looking at needs to be to
the right of all of those
so if we look at our example here our
first pivot in the 1 1 position
there's nothing above it so there's
nothing to worry about in the second row
we're looking at the 2 3 position
there's one pivot above this second pivot but the
second pivot
is indeed to the right so that's okay
then we when we go to our third pivot
our third pivot is here in the 3 4
position
there are two pivots above this third
pivot but this third pivot is
to the right of both of them so um for
pivots we go
right and down um we go right and down
so
uh the third rule passes here so we are
on track to be reduced row echelon form
i promise there are four rules though
what's the fourth rule the fourth rule
says that
all non-pivot entries and a column
containing a pivot
must be equal to zero so if we look at
our example here
we have three pivots which means we have
three pivot columns
and the rule says that every column that
has a pivot
can have the pivot but then everything
else is equal to zero
so if we look at our first column here
um we have our pivot
and everything else in the column is
equal to zero that's cool
then in our next uh column with a pivot
that's the third column of this matrix
we have our pivot position and
everything else is equal to zero
great and then for our third pivot in
the fourth column
we have our pivot position and
everything else is equal to zero
the fourth rule passes here so we can
call this matrix
reduced row echelon form so
the way we write this is we write so we
called this matrix r
so what we would write here to
efficiently communicate that this matrix
is in reduced row echelon form
is we would write r equals r r
e f of r r e f
is an abbreviation of reduced row
echelon form
great so these matrices play an
enormously important role for us
so it's important that we understand how
to identify them
it's key here that there are four rules
and the matrix needs to pass
all four of those rules um or follow
all four of those rules if we're going
to call it a reduced row echelon form
so let's look at a few examples to test
our understanding here
so here we have a new matrix also called
r
this one's a little bit bigger i think
this one looks like it's a 5
by 5 by 7 matrix so this is a larger
matrix
so what are the rules the first rule
says that if there are rows of zeros
they can be there but they have to be at
the bottom and here we do
actually have rows of zeros um the last
two rows of this matrix
are all zeros um but that's fine because
they're at the bottom of the matrix
so the first rule passes what about the
second rule
the second rule says that all of the
other rows so the rows that aren't all
zeros
have to have first non-zero entry equal
to one
so if we look at the the first row here
the first row starts with a one
that's great that's our first pivot in
the second row we start with two zeros
that's fine but the first non-zero entry
is in this 2 3 position that's equal to
1
that's our second pivot now when we look
at our third row this is the only
remaining row that's not
all zeros if we the first one
two three four positions are all zero
totally fine
the next position is the first non-zero
entry in the third row
it is equal to one that's our third
pivot the second rule passes
and here we have three pivots
the third rule says that the pivots need
to move right
and down so every pivot needs to be to
the right of all pivots above it
so to get from the first to the second
we travel right and down
great to get from the second to the
third we travel right and down great
the third rule passes the fourth rule
says
each pivot needs to be the only non-zero
entry
and its column so if we look at the
first pivot
it is the only non-zero entry in its
column we have the pivot
and everything else is equal to zero
good
if we look at the second pivot it is the
only
non-zero entry in its column so we have
our pivot here in the third
column and everything else is equal to
zero great
and then finally our last pivot is in
the fifth column here one two three four
five in the fifth column
the pivot's there everything else is
equal to zero the rule passes
there's no other pivots to verify here
so great this
this is another example of a matrix
that's in reduced row echelon form
so here it's appropriate to write r
equals
r r e f r this matrix is in reduced row
echelon form one thing that's important
to point out here
is we require pivots to equal one but
not
every one in the matrix is a pivot for
example
in this uh here we have a one in the
first row
and the one two three four five six
position so this is in the one sixth
position
this is equal to one but it is not a
pivot a pivot
is the first non-zero entry of a row
that's not all zeros and and when we say
something is in reduced for echelon form
the pivots have to equal one
let's look at our next example so here
we have a smaller matrix this one
looks like it's what three by five
um what are the rules the first rule
says that if there is a row of zeros
it needs to be at the bottom in this
example there are no rows
that are all zeros so we don't have to
worry about the first rule
first rule passes the second rule
says that all of the other rows so in
this case all of the rows
have to have a first non-zero entry
equal to one
well in the first row we start with a
one that's our first pivot
in the second row we have we start with
a zero which is fine and the first
non-zero entry is in the second position
so the two two position here
that's equal to one so we're good and
then finally
um in uh in the third row we start with
three zeros
totally fine and then the first non-zero
entry
is in the um a fourth column that's
equal to one
we have our pivots so the pivot axiom
passes
um our other rule says that pivots must
occur from right and down so every pivot
must be to the right of
every pivot above it um to get from the
first to the second pivot we travel to
the right and down
great to get from the second to the
third pivot we travel right and down
great so we have pivots the pivots go
um our every pivot is to the right of
every pivot above it
that's great so we have one more rule to
check and that rule says that pivots can
be the only non-zero entry
in their respective columns if we look
at the first pivot in this matrix
um we have the pivot and then two zeros
great
if we look at the second pivot we have
the pivot and then two zeros
great and then we're just about to get
there however
if we look at the third pivot in this
matrix we have the pivot position
but right above it is a two two is not
equal to zero
so that axiom fails our rule for reduce
for echelon form we almost got there
but the rule that says that uh pivots
can be the only non-zero entry in their
respective columns
fails so even though we're real close
this matrix is not in reduced row
echelon form
so here we write r not equal to r
r e f r we almost got there
but not quite so again the rules for
reduce for echelon form
are super strict we have to pass all
four of the rules
in order to be in reduced row echelon
form we got close
but we didn't make it here uh so cross
it out
uh what here's another example so this
one's pretty big as well
uh this is like six by seven
um let's run through the axiom so as you
start to do a lot of these you get more
comfortable with the axioms
here we have two rows of zeros they're
at the bottom
everything's good so far um if we look
at all of the other rows
the very first entries that are that's
not a zero
is a one so we have our first pivot in
the one one position
our second position in the two five
position
our uh third pivot is in the three
three position and our fourth pivot is
in the what one
two three four one two three four five
the four six
position so the first non-zero entry of
every row that's not
all zeros is equal to one so we have
pivots
and if we look at all these pivot
columns uh the pivots are
the only non-zero entries in their
respective columns
so we're doing pretty good on the axioms
but you may have already seen it by now
as you can tell not every pivot is to
the right of
all of the pivots above it to get from
the second pivot to the third pivot
we travel to the left and down so even
though we're real close with this one as
well
this matrix is not in reduced row
echelon form
we passed most of the axioms we passed
most the rules but we didn't pass all of
them
so this is not in reduced row echelon
form
real close but not quite there
so cross it out
