so why am i so excited to talk about
reduced for echelon form matrices
um well studying reduced for echelon for
matrices is pretty interesting
uh there are certain adjectives we can
use to describe reduced row echelon for
matrices
that end up proving useful so uh now i
want to talk about what's called
rank and nullity and these are two of
the most important concepts in all of
linear algebra
so um let's say that we're working with
a matrix that's in reduced row echelon
form
the first thing so so to remind yourself
right
this is in reduce row echelon form there
is a row of zeros but it's at the bottom
uh we have three pivots they uh they
move down and to the right
and they're the only non-zero entries in
their respective columns
so i have my pivots um the first thing
to learn
is that every reduced row echelon form
matrix
has pivot columns and non-pivot columns
so when we're talking about the columns
of a reduced row echelon form matrix
we'll call the columns that have pivots
in them pivot columns
and we'll call the columns without
pivots in them non-pivot columns
so in this matrix we have three pivot
columns
because we have three pivots in this
reduced row echelon form matrix
there are two remaining columns so there
are two columns that don't have pivots
in them
these are called non-pivot columns so
once you have your matrix in reduced row
echelon form it's quite simple
to figure out which are the pivot
columns and which are the non-pivot
columns
simply locate your pivots the columns
with the pivots in them are the pivot
columns
the columns without pivots in them are
the non-pivot columns
all right so now one of my favorite
definitions rank
so if we're working with a matrix in
reduced row echelon form
we call the rank the number of pivot
columns
so the rank is the number of pivot
columns which is really just the same
thing as the number of pivots
so if we go to our example here remember
rank
is the number of pivot columns all we
need to do to figure out the rank
is just count the number of pivots and
that tells us what the rank is
there's three pivots here which means
there's three pivot columns
that tells us the rank is equal to three
now rank couples nicely with this other
concept called the nullity
the nullity of a matrix is the number of
non-pivot
columns so here we're working with
a four by five matrix
and the rank is three because we had
three pivots
well the nullity is the number of
non-pivot columns
well since there are three pivot columns
there's two other columns remaining
so that means that there are two
non-pivot columns which means that the
nullity
of this matrix is equal to 2.
so we have pivot columns and non-pivot
columns
the number of pivot columns is called
the rank
and the number of non-pivot columns is
called the nullity
these these two concepts are extremely
important
okay so here is a much larger matrix
this matrix is
in reduced row echelon form and i went
ahead and i found all the pivots
in this case we have four pivots
because there are four pivots there are
consequently four pivot columns
which means that the rank of this
reduced row echelon four matrix
is equal to four what about the nullity
well to calculate the nullity we just
need to figure out the number of
non-pivot columns so how many columns in
this matrix don't have a pivot in them
well let's just count them we have 1 2
3 4 5 6.
so in this matrix there are six columns
that don't have a pivot
in it so in them so the nullity of this
matrix is equal to
6. so here we're in reduced row echelon
form which means it's
easy to locate where the pivots are here
we happen to have
four of them so there are four pivot
columns
which means the rank is four and
um when we counted the number of
non-pivot columns we counted six of them
so the nullity of this matrix is equal
to six
again if you're in reduced row echelon
form it's very simple to figure out the
rank in the melody
figure out the number of pivot columns
that's the rank figure out the number of
non-pivot columns that's the nullity
and now we arrive at believe it or not
one of the most elegant theorems
in all of mathematics at least this is
one of my favorite theorems in all of
mathematics
this is called the rank nullity theorem
and the cool thing about this theorem
is that there are certain ways to state
it where it seems like a completely
obvious thing
but then it creeps up in other areas
where it's far less obvious
hopefully we've set things up here so
that the statement of the theorem
is relatively easy to understand if so
if you think about it
um a matrix that's in reduced row
echelon form has
only two kinds of columns there's pivot
columns which is
the columns that have pivots in them and
there's non-pivot columns which are the
columns that don't have pivots in them
well every column fits one of those two
descriptions so when we sum
the number of pivot columns with the
number of non-pivot columns we get the
total number of columns
this is the idea behind the rank nullity
theorem
so let's state this more rigorously
let's say that
r is m by n and let's say that we're
working with r
which is in reduced row echelon form so
r is a matrix
with m rows and n columns and r's
in reduced row echelon form the rank
nullity theorem
is one simple equation it says that the
rank
of our reduced row echelon form matrix
plus the nullity of our reduced row
echelon form matrix
is equal to n and an even simpler way of
thinking of that is simply
the rank plus the nullity is always the
number of columns
so let's see this in practice again the
rank nullity theorem
says that the rank plus the nullity
always equals the number of columns
and one of the useful things about an
equation
is especially an equation like this is
that if you
know all everything except one piece of
information in the equation
you can use the equation to infer your
missing piece of information
in other words if you the rank nullity
theorem is a relationship between
three numbers the rank the nullity and
the number of columns
so if you know one or if you know two of
the three numbers here
you can use the rank nullity theorem to
infer the third missing number
let's see some examples so here i'm
giving you an example
where i'm pretentiously writing r is an
arrow or can be viewed as a
transformation from
r five to r nine remember this is really
just a pretentious way of saying that
r is a nine by five matrix
and let's say that someone told us that
the rank of this matrix was
2. well if the rank was 2
and we know that the rank plus the
nullity equals the number of columns
it must be the case that the nullity
can be solved for here and it should be
the number of columns
minus the rank so in this case the
number of columns is five
someone has told us the rank is two five
minus two is three
now we know the nullity so here we had
an example
where we knew the the shape of the
matrix we knew that the matrix was nine
by five
someone told us that the rank was two
and then we used the rank nullity
theorem
to figure out ourselves that the nullity
had to be three
let's see another example in this
example
we're representing r as a process that
takes vectors in r
12 to vectors in r seven
remember this is just a fancy way of
saying that this matrix is
7 by 12 so there are 7 rows and 12
columns
let's say that we don't know the rank
but someone tells us that the nullity
is 4 well i know the number of columns
and i know the nullity so i can use the
rank nullity theorem
to infer the ring the rank
should be equal to the number of columns
minus the nullity
well the number of columns here is 12
and 12 minus the melody would be 12
minus 4 which is equal to 8. so in other
words if you tell me that
r is a 7 by 12 matrix with nullity 4
the rank nullity theorem automatically
tells me that the rank had to equal 8.
great let's see one more example here
we're representing r is a process that
goes from r to the question mark so
we don't know that number to r6 and
someone is telling us that the rank
of this matrix is 5 and the nullity of
this matrix is 3.
so the question now is well r
was a process that went from where to
where or in other words
r is a six by question mark matrix
what is question mark well question mark
should be the number of columns
and the number of columns is always the
rank plus the nullity
since the rank is five and the nullity
is three i automatically know
that the number of columns has to equal
eight which is five plus three
and that's the power of the rank nullity
theorem so this is a nice uh i i sort of
like these examples because
they're sort of um a nice examples of
situations where you might have
incomplete information
but the ranked melody theory theorem in
these particular situations
allows you to get full information
