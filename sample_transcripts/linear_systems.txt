one of the most important applications
and one of the most classical
applications
of matrix theory is to the theory of
systems of linear equations.
so here we're looking at a general
system of
m linear equations with n variables.
the idea here is that we're looking at a
list of equations
where the variables are given by x1 x2
all the way up to xn. so we have n
variables
and the idea is that we are scaling each
of these variables
by some constants which we're denoting
by a's with subscripts here.
and then we add everything up and we set
each equation equal to some other
constant
and on the right hand side we're using
b's to denote those constants.
we call this system linear because with
each of the variables
we're not doing anything fancy like
squaring them or exponentiating or
taking trig functions,
we're only looking at the variables
themselves.
a solution to a system of
equations is a vector denoted maybe by
x whose coordinates solve each equation.
so we would say x here is a solution
if when we plugged in all of these
coordinates into all of the equations
all of the equations were satisfied. so
the name of the game is if you give me a
system
can i find solutions.
well systems that have solutions are
called consistent.
so a system is consistent if it has at
least one solution.
so here we have an example of a system
of equations.
here it looks like we have four
equations and three variables
and i went home and i managed to find
two solutions.
i found that if you plug in x one equals
five
x two equals two and x three equals zero
in the system all of the equations are
satisfied.
i also found that if you set x 1 equal
to 6
x 2 equal to 3 and x 3 equal to negative
1
also all of the equations are satisfied.
so evidently this system has at least
two solutions and maybe there are others
out there
but the the point here is that the
system is consistent because it has
at least one solution.
on the other end of the spectrum we have
inconsistent systems.
inconsistent systems are systems that
have zero solutions or no solutions.
here we have an example of an
inconsistent system of equations.
so here we have four equations with
three variables
and the thing i want to point out here
is that if we added
all these equations together we end up
with the equation
0 equals 1. so if we added all of these
equations together
keep track of the coefficients negative
5 times
x1 minus 4 times x1 is negative 9x1
but then we add 2x1 and and 7x1 that's
plus 9x1 so we get 0.
if we add 4x2 plus 1x2 that's 5x2
but then minus two x two minus three x
two is negative five
x two so that cancels to zero and then
negative x three minus x three is
negative two x three
but then plus x three plus x three is
plus two x three
and that also cancels so if we added all
the equations together
on one side of the equal sign we would
get 0 and then what happens on the right
hand side
we get 3 plus 1 which is 2 plus 2 which
is 4
minus 3 which is 1. so we get 1 on the
right-hand side of the equal sign
and this is a problem because 0 is not
equal to 1.
so it's impossible to find a solution to
this system because if you did find a
solution
you could just add the equations
together and conclude that zero equals
one.
so this is an example of a system that
has no solutions this is an
inconsistent system.
so how does all this relate to linear
algebra and specifically matrices.
well there are two ways we use matrices
to represent
systems. the first in a
way with that we use matrices to
represent systems is through what's
called an
augmented matrix. an augmented matrix
sort of concedes to the idea
that the important thing about a system
isn't the variables in the system
it's the coefficients inside of the
system.
so uh here's how we construct an
augmented matrix to represent a system.
uh the first thing we do is we keep
track of all
of the coefficients of all of the
variables
in the system and we place them into a
matrix.
so uh here we see in our system of
equations
that we have four equations with three
variables.
so in our augmented matrix we will have
four rows and then the first three
columns of this matrix
will tell me the coefficients of each of
the variables.
so uh the the coefficients in the
equations for x1
are 3 6 2 negative 7. so the first
column of this matrix
is 3 6 2 negative 7.
the coefficients for x2 are 7
0 because x2 doesn't appear in the
second equation
9 4. so the second column of the
coefficient matrix here
is 7 0 9 4.
and then the third column should be 4 9
0 negative 12 and that's the third
column here
4 9 0 negative 12. so the idea is that
we're ripping out all the coefficients
from the system
and we're placing all of those
coefficients in the appropriate
positions of this new matrix.
sometimes when we're doing this i like
to label the first
columns of the matrix to remind myself
which variable
was placed where. now
the coefficient matrix itself doesn't
convey all of the data of the system
because we also need to know these
constants that occur to the right of the
equal signs.
so what we do now is in our augmented
matrix you'll see before i box things
here.
we drew a vertical line this vertical
line doesn't denote anything
mathematically as far as the matrix is
concerned it's really for
a visual guide for us to remind us where
the equal sign occurred
in the equations. and so what we do now
is we just take
all of the coefficients that occurred to
the right of the equal sign
and place them into the last column of
this matrix
so that's to the right of that vertical
bar.
this is called the augmented column of
our augmented matrix.
so the idea here is that if you give me
the system i can represent it with an
augmented matrix
and conversely if you give me the
augmented matrix i can recover the
system.
so so uh what we're doing is we're
re-representing or we're representing
the data inside of the system
using a matrix.
another way we use matrices to talk
about systems of equations
is with a matrix equation it turns out
we can use the same data of the
coefficient matrix and the augmented
column
to write down a matrix equation that
conveys the information
in the system. so this always manifests
as a matrix equation of the form
a times the variable vector x equals b
where a is the coefficient matrix of the
system
and b is the augmented column of the
system or the
the column of constants that occurs to
the right of all the equal signs.
both of these perspectives will prove
useful to us. we'll find
that um augmented matrices are useful
for algorithms we discuss
and also matrix equations are useful as
we start to learn more and more about
matrix arithmetic.
