for our second lecture
i want to introduce the notion of a
digraph um
and its connections to the concepts of
matrices and vector
vectors as we've developed them so far.
so what is a
digraph so a diagraph is uh shorthand
for
uh the notion of a directed graph. and a
directed graph
is a very simple object. it is a
collection of nodes
and arrows so a typical digraph might
look something like this.
so the thing to pay attention to here is
we are looking at a figure
where we have a bunch of like dots here
which are labeled
as v's with subscripts and then we have
a bunch of arrows pointing in between
these dots. um these dots are called
nodes and the arrows are called arrows.
and so for example in this figure
we are looking at a directed graph or a
digraph
with six nodes so if we count the nodes
there are one two
three four five six and
seven arrows so if we count the arrows
we see there's one two
um three four five six
seven. and why are digraphs interesting
and worth talking
about. um well in applications digraphs
are used
to describe relationships between
objects.
so if you're thinking about something
that you care about in the world and
that thing can be
explained at least modeled by um
uh things that have relationships with
one another.
um a digraph might be a useful tool to
study the thing you care about.
so here's a sort of typical kind of
example so we can
imagine like our financial network as
just a giant
digraph.and here the idea is that um
each node in this diagraph represents
some financial institution. so here i
have
the logos for three famous banks um
and uh the arrows pointing between these
uh uh nodes
might represent transactions between
these banks.
so this first arrow here t1 might
represent
um a transaction where wells fargo sends
chase bank some money
um and then t2 might be another
transaction where chase
sends wells fargo some money and these
other transactions represent
other uh banks sending other banks money
um. so here the idea is that we're
modeling transactions between
financial institutions and
of course this is a very simplified uh
model. uh if we wanted to account for all
transactions in
you know maybe all banks in the united
states uh we'd have
a much more complicated uh figure.
search engines work can be modeled this
way so search engines use hyperlink data
to model the internet.
so here i have the logos of four famous
websites
and then i have arrows pointing between
all these various websites.
uh maybe in this model the idea is that
each arrow
in this directed graph represents a link
from one website to another.
so in this diagraph maybe wikipedia has
a link
labeled l1 from wikipedia to amazon.
maybe l2 is another link from wikipedia
to amazon
um maybe on amazon there's a link to
wikipedia
maybe there's also a link to youtube so
on and so forth.
so again here i just have a small
example to illustrate a much
larger model.
so here the idea is that we're modeling
hyperlinks between web pages.
um and social networks could be modeled
this way if you wanted to.
um here i have a figure uh i guess
facebook released this i don't remember
the year but i have the uh reference
down here
i think it's from 2010 but it might
actually be later um
and so what you're looking at is a
directed graph they constructed
to model their social network so the
idea is that there's probably
billions of arrows here representing
connections
between accounts.
okay so let's see
