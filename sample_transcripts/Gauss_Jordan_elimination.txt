the gauss-jordan algorithm this is very
exciting.
so we just saw in the last lecture that
we care about solving
linear systems of equations and if the
system we're studying is in reduced row
echelon form
then writing down then there's a
systematic procedure for
writing down all solutions to the system.
of course the problem is that if we are
come across a system of equations
in the wild is almost guaranteed to not
be in reduced row echelon form.
so how do we take something that's ugly
not in reduced row echelon form
and turn it into something that's nice
meaning in reduced row echelon form.
well the gauss-jordan algorithm is
exactly the tool for the job.
so let's discuss gauss-jordan
elimination.
so the first thing to learn is that
there are three types of elementary row
operations.
the first type is called row switching
and
this says that if we are working in this
way
um we can simply take two rows and
switch them and that's called that's the
first type of elementary row operation.
the notation we use to indicate that we
are switching the i throw with the j
throw is sort of vector r sub i and then
a double arrow
vector r sub j. the next type of
elementary row operation is called row
scaling.
here the idea is that we can take any
row so we can take maybe the i throw
and then we can scale by any non-zero
zero number.
so the notation we use for this is we
write scalar
times the uh i th row so vector r sub i
and then we write right arrow r sub i. to
indicate that the new i throw
is obtained by scaling the old i throw
by the non-zero number
c and the third type of elementary row
operation
is called row addition. here the idea
is that we can take one of the rows
maybe row i
and then add a scalar multiple of
another row maybe row j.
so the the notation here says we can
take
the i throw so vector r sub i and then
add any scalar multiple c times the j
throw to the i throw and then send that
to the new i throw.
so the new i throw is obtained by taking
the old i throw
and then adding c times the uh j old
j j throw which is the same as the new j
throw because
uh the j j throw here is not changed by
the procedure.
okay so let's see uh these examples or
some examples of this in action.
so here what we're going to do is we're
going to take this perfectly good three
by four matrix
and we're going to perform a row switch.
we're going to take the first row and
switch it with the third row so.
so how does that work well we have our
first and third rows
and then when we do the elementary row
operation we switch the first and third
rows it's that simple.
what about row scaling so here we're
going to take this perfectly good
three by two matrix and this notation
says
we should take the second row and then
scale it by negative three so here's the
second row.
um let's let's uh perform the row
operation by scaling it by negative 3.
so we take the original negative 5
negative 7
when we multiply by negative 3 we
produce the new row
15 21.
finally for row addition the example
here is a little larger
here we're taking this four by five
matrix
and we're going to do the operation
where we take the third row
and subtract four times the first row
from it
and then that becomes the new third row
so
here's the third row of our matrix
and now the idea is that i'm going to
take this row and then subtract off
four times the first row so the first
row
is is right here. so how does the
arithmetic work well i'm going to take
apparently negative one and then
subtract four times two so that's
negative one times
eight that becomes negative nine.
then i do the same thing for all of the
other coordinates
in the uh third row here.
so um these are the three types of
elementary row operation
row switching row scaling and row
addition.
okay so the idea now is that if we have
something ugly some generic matrix
that's hard to work with we will use
elementary row operations to make the
matrix better.
so um it turns out there's a theorem
that says we can do this.
every matrix a can be row reduced
to one and only one reduced row echelon
form matrix.
so let's see an example of this in
action we will present an
algorithm for doing this so it's a
systematic list of procedures
for uh taking some a matrix and then
doing row operations to get to reduce
row echelon form.
but for now i just want us to think
about the idea what would we do
if we wanted to get from something not
in reduced row echelon form
to something in reduced row echelon form.
so here we have a perfectly good
two by three matrix but it's clearly not
in reduced row echelon form.
well what's the problem well if we look
at the first row
the first entry is not a pivot because
in reduced row echelon form
we need this entry to equal one.
so let's fix the problem by using a row
operation
how about we take that row so so the
problem here is the negative 9.
let's take that whole first row and
scale by negative 1
9. so if we multiply the entire first
row by negative 1 9
the negative 9 becomes a 1 now the 18
becomes a negative 2 and the 20 becomes
negative 20 over 9. so
we're actually a little bit closer to
reduce for echelon form because now
we have a pivot this this first entry is
equal to a one
so that can be our first pivot in our
reduced row echelon form.
of course we're not there yet because
another axiom for reduced row echelon
form
says wherever we have a pivot we have to
have all zeros
in the column except for the pivot. so of
course the issue now
is that right below my pivot i have this
negative five
well i want to get rid of this negative
five and if you think of the row
operations available to
us only one will do it so we can't do a
row switch to get rid of the negative
five that would mess with the pivot that
we just worked so hard to get.
i can't do a row scaling to get rid of
the negative five
it's tempting to just multiply this
entire row by zero
but remember for row scaling we're not
allowed to scale by
zero. so the only thing left is row
addition
and the general principle says if you're
trying to get rid of entries in a pivot
column
take advantage of the pivot. so here what
we really want to do is we want to
manipulate row two
using row one and the right a way to do
this is to take
row two and add five times row one
so now let's do that. so what is row two
plus five times row one well now we know
that we'll get a zero
in the two one position and then we have
ten plus five times negative two that's
also zero
and then if we do the fractional
arithmetic we'll take 11
and then add 10 times negative 20 over 9
and that ends up giving us a negative 1
9.
so we have successfully eliminated
the entry right below our first pivot
and so now that entry is okay great
so uh we're doing a pretty good job.
we're a lot closer to reduce our echelon
form than when we started
but we're still not there. we have our
first pivot
and um the column is now legit um uh the
only other entry is a zero
so we're done with our first pivot
column.
now we ask ourselves well where might
the next pivot be and the only possible
position
would be in this uh 2 3 position where
we have a negative 1
9. well remember in reduced row echelon
form pivots have to equal 1.
so how can we take this negative 1 9 and
make it a 1.
well we can use row scaling we can
multiply
the uh second row by negative nine and
that produces a one
in the two three position that will be
our next pivot.
so now we're a lot closer to reduced row
echelon form i now have
two pivots but i'm not quite there
because
right above my second pivot is negative
20 over nine.
i need to get rid of that negative 20
over 9 in order to be in reduced row
echelon form
and here we can use row addition. what we
want to do is we want to take
row 1 and then
subtract off negative 20 over 9 times
row 2.
so that's the same thing as taking row 1
and adding
20 over 9 times row 2 to it.
when we do that we successfully get rid
of the
non-zero entry above our second pivot
and we have a zero.
and now if we stare at where we're at we
realize this uh
at this stage we are in reduced row
echelon form.
so um we've successfully found what's
called
rref of a. we started with a two by three
matrix that was not in reduced row
echelon form
and we carefully chose row reductions
until we ended up in reduced row echelon
form.
