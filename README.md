# Zoom App

## Duke Code+ 2021 Zoom App Development Team
ReView is a web app that uses video transcripts to summarize class recordings and tag key topics to make studying for tests and understanding material covered in each lecture easier with minimal effort by the professor. ReView not only functions as a study tool, but as a way to help professors organize recording content, make class materials more accessible, and create a way to increase engagement with course content.
